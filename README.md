## License & Copying

This repo is meant to function as an experimental workspace for me and a box
of spare parts for anybody. You are welcome to re-use what you find here.

Files in this repo are dual licensed as **"Apache-2.0 OR MIT"** unless marked
otherwise. Check the SPDX header comments. An "OR" in the License Identifier
header means you can choose to use that file under either license, or both. The
point of the dual license is to give you more options for submitting board
definitions or sample code to upstream projects.

For the dual licensed files, if you want to pick one license, it's fine to
remove the other license from the SPDX License Identifier header in your copy
of the code.
